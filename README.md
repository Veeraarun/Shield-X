# Shield X - AI-Powered Threat Monitor

## Overview

**Shield X** is a web-based application developed for a college hackathon event. It leverages the Google Safe Browsing API to analyze and detect the risk level of any URL, helping users stay safe from malicious, suspicious, or phishing links. The project features a simple and intuitive interface, making it easy for anyone to check the safety of a link before clicking.
